Princeton community members can keep informed by subscribing to our [listserv](https://lists.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=JULIA-USER-GROUP). We also have a Slack channel in the [Data-Driven Social Science workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ddss-princeton/signup). Slide and code snippets from previous meetings are available from the group's [GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/princeton-ddss/julia-user-group).

## Organizers
The group is maintained by research software engineers Colin Swaney ([colinswaney@princeton.edu](colinswaney@princeton.edu)) and Luca Boldonado ([lucaboldonado@princeton.edu](lucaboldonado@princeton.edu)).
