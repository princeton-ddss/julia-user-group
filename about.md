The Princeton Julia User Group is a group for students, researchers and developers at Princeton University to discuss and promote the Julia programming language. We aim to help participants improve their Julia skills and facilitate the adoption of Julia as the default choice for high-performance research software on campus.

Our monthly meetings provide a friendly environment for participants to ask questions, seek advice, share their Julia knowledgeâ€”and receive sustenance. From the merely curious to the experienced Julian, all those interested in Julia are welcome.

The Julia User Group is co-sponsored by [Data-Driven Social Sciences](https://ddss.princeton.edu) and [Princeton Research Computing](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu).
