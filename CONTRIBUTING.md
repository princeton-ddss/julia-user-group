# Contributing
Would you like to contribute a talk to the Princeton Julia User Group? That's excellent! We are extremely grateful for your participation. This document will guide you through the process of adding a talk/post to our website.

> [!NOTE]
> Our website is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you want to preview changes locally (or if you want to contribute to the website beyond adding a post), you'll need to learn how to work with Jekyll. Don't worryâ€”it's easy! There are a million resources for learning Jekyll, including Jekyll's own excellent documentation, and someone on Reddit probably knows the answer to your question.

There are three talk formats you can publish to the website:

1. Markdown
2. Pluto
3. HTML

Let's take a look at how each of the options works.

## Markdown
One option is to write up your talk in Markdown. This is the simplest option. The main downside is that Markdown code blocks are non-interactive, which means readers need to do a lot of copy-pasting if the talk has a "follow-along" design.

### Step 1: Create a Markdown file
Write up your talk in Markdown file, e.g., `plotting-in-julia.md`.

### Step 2: Create a feature branch
Create a new feature branch off of `gh-pages`. Use the title of your talk as the branch name, e.g., `git checkout -b plotting-with-julia`.

### Step 3: Create a post
Create a new file, e.g. `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-plotting-in-julia.md`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date of your presentation. Paste the following at the top of the new file and modify the metadata as necessary:
```markdown
---
layout: post
title:  Plotting in Julia
author: James T. Kirk
date:   2025-10-05 10:00:00 -0500
categories: meetings talks
preview: false
---
```

> [!NOTE]
> A website admin may have created this post file for you already. In that case, simply modify the metadata as necessay.

If the talk has already occurred, then set `preview` to `true`. Also, please make sure that the stated date and time are accurate.

Now all you need to do finish the post is copy-paste the body of your Markdown file below the header. The first paragraph of text will display as a post preview on the homepage.

### Step 4: Create a PR
Once you're happy with the post, go ahead and open a pull request to merge into `gh-pages`. An admin will review the post, make formatting changes if necessary, and then publish your work (and thank you profusely)!

## Pluto
Another option is to create a [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebook. Pluto notebooks are nice because users can interact with them. Unfortunately, our Jekyll website doesn't support interaction, so we only host static HTML notebook exports.

The steps to contribute a talk as a Pluto notebook are the same as Markdown instructions above except that instead of copying your Markdown to the `.md` post file:

1. First, add a paragraph of preview text to your post's  `.md` file
2. Next, add a link to your Pluto notebook:
```
[Notebook](/julia-user-group/notebooks/plotting-in-julia.html)
```
3. Finally, export your Pluto notebook as static HTML and copy to `/notebooks`

If you go the Pluto route, we would also ask that you add your notebook to the `main` branch. Simply create a new directory in `/talks` and add any files that support your talk.

## HTML
Finally, we can host HTML documents. For example, you can convert a slide presentation to HTML. The process for contributing an HTML document is exactly the same as that of contributing a static export of a Pluto notebook.
