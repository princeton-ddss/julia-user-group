Many Julia projects begin with a few basic script files that help a researcher perform a concrete task. Sometimes, those scripts turn out to be quite useful to a lab department, or even an entire research community. At that point, you really need a better way of sharing your code other than just passing copies around. You need a way to enable collaboration while keeping your code reusable, maintainable and correct. In short, you need a package. This talk will demonstrate how Julia solves packaging by showing you how to go from script to package in (about) an hour.
