Julia prides itself on being a language that excels in terms of both runtime *and* development time. One reason for the latter is that the Julia community prioritizes and builds essential functionality for research developers into `Base`. Parallel computing provides a case-in-point. The term "parallel computing" encompasses several distinct computational methods. Julia supports three classical parallel computing paradigms "out-of-the-box", while the Julia ecosystem provides tightly-integrated support for more recent paradigms, e.g., accelerators and GPUs.
